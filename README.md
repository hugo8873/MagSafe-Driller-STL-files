# MagSafe Magnetic Ring Slotting Tool for Phone Cases

This repository contains a 3D model designed to help you create a precise slot for a MagSafe magnetic ring on your phone case. The model is compatible with standard printing materials and can be used with basic tools such as sandpaper, glue, and either manual or electric tools. The design ensures a maximum slot depth of 1mm, preventing over-drilling and potential damage to your phone case. However, if your phone case is particularly thin, it is not recommended to attempt this modification.

## Features
- **1mm Maximum Slot Depth**: The model is designed to stop at 1mm depth, ensuring your phone case won't be punctured.
- **DIY-Friendly**: Utilizes common materials like sandpaper, glue, and basic tools.
- **Compatibility**: Tested on an iPhone 15 Pro with a Clicks keyboard case, but can be adapted for other phone cases.

## Steps to Use

1. **1:1 Print the 3D Model**: Ensure the model is printed at its actual size.
2. **Attach Sandpaper**: Use glue to attach a piece of coarse sandpaper to the back of the rotating part of the model.
3. **Cut the Sandpaper**: Once the glue is dry, cut the sandpaper into a ring shape following the edge of the model.
4. **Position the Model**: Accurately position the fixed part of the model on your phone case where you want the slot. For precise placement, you can use a MagSafe ring as a guide and trace its outline with a pen.
5. **Start Sanding**: After the glue has set, begin sanding. If using an electric tool, be cautious of heat buildup to avoid warping your phone case.
6. **Check Depth**: Periodically check the depth of the slot. Once satisfied, insert the MagSafe magnetic ring into the slot.
